# WebVR Demos

Here's a list of WebVR demos that you can view in Edge running on a Windows Mixed Reality Headset.

To lauch a WebVR demo:

* Click on the link to open the website
* Select the "view in WebVR" button, usually a stylized pair of goggles.

Alternatively, you can use Edge from within the "Cliff House" created used by the Windows Mixed Reality Portal, and open an instance of Edge there, before following the same instructions.
